Added 'paperclip' and 'aws-sdk' to gemfile to allow paperclip to work

Add attachment_validation to user

Add index and new for user to upload photo

Form will not work since @user is currently nil, implement this in your current app

For API request a sample request (if you have current_user up) is to post:
{image: \"INSERT BASE64 ENCODED STRING OF FILE HERE\"}

to process that base code use this method

def process_avatar
  if params[:user] && params[:user][:image]
    data = StringIO.new(Base64.decode64(params[:user][:image][:data]))
    data.class.class_eval { attr_accessor :original_filename, :content_type }
    data.original_filename = params[:user][:image][:filename]
    data.content_type = params[:user][:image][:content_type]
    params[:user][:image] = data
  end
end

^^This method of transferring images is for very small in size and small in amount of images, if you think that there may come a time when you will have hundreds or thousands of images and your hosted app can't handle that then read the blog post I send you from my blog. If you use AWS S3 then it will work wonderfully
